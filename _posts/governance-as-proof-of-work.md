title: "Governance as Proof of Work"
excerpt: "As AI agents participate in blockchain governance, the system begins to resemble proof-of-work in unexpected ways. Attention becomes compute, ideas become memes with half-lives, and the search for novelty mirrors mining."

What happens when LLMs take over blockchain governance? The system starts to look surprisingly like proof-of-work — just operating on attention instead of electricity.

## The Disappearing Developer

In an LLM-driven governance model, the identity of individual core developers fades into the background. What matters isn't *who* proposed a change, but whether the change survives the selection process.

This mirrors how Bitcoin mining works: the identity of the miner who finds a block is irrelevant to the validity of that block. The work speaks for itself.

## Attention as Compute

Consider how attention flows through governance:

- **Global attention** represents the total compute power available to LLMs participating in protocol decisions
- **Focused attention** on specific problems mirrors how our brains allocate cognitive resources
- **Attention competition** between proposals resembles hash rate competition between miners

The more attention a proposal attracts from capable agents, the more thoroughly it gets analyzed, debated, and stress-tested. Attention *is* the work.

## One Chain to Rule Them All

It's unlikely we maintain two dominant global chains long-term. This is analogous to traffic control systems — you can have local variations, but the fundamental protocols need to be unified for the network to function.

Regional and cultural differences might still emerge in infrastructure and implementation details. But the core protocol layer tends toward consolidation, just as the internet did.

## Accelerating Change

If governance becomes fully LLM-driven, the pace of change could accelerate dramatically:

- **EIPs submitted like transactions** — protocol improvements proposed, debated, and decided within blocks rather than across months
- **Continuous protocol evolution** — the chain modified every block rather than through discrete hard forks
- **Real-time adaptation** — parameters tuned dynamically based on network conditions

## The PoS Counterbalance

Capital provides inertia against this acceleration.

Proof-of-stake validators have skin in the game. Capital naturally avoids volatility and risk — stakers don't want their chain to change so fast that their economic assumptions break.

This creates a productive tension:
- **Governance** pushes for continuous improvement
- **Capital** demands stability and predictability

The equilibrium between these forces determines the actual rate of protocol evolution.

## The Exhaustion of Ideas

Here's a provocative thought: the current design space may be nearly exhausted.

The existing world of blockchain ideas resembles a late-stage Go game. The major territories have been claimed. What remains is filling gaps along the borders — optimizations, edge cases, incremental improvements.

AI will fill these gaps quickly. It's well-suited to exploring known design spaces systematically.

Then what?

## The New Idea Problem

Once the existing design space is mapped, finding genuinely novel ideas requires one of two approaches:

1. **Physical world experiments** — testing ideas against reality, which can't be simulated
2. **Randomized search** — essentially proof-of-work, but for concepts instead of hashes

This search process is inherently expensive. You have to try many things that don't work to find the few that do. The computational cost of exploring possibility space becomes the new "mining."

## Ideas as Memes

Ideas found through this process behave like memes:

- **Virality** — good ideas spread rapidly through the agent network
- **Explosiveness** — breakthrough concepts can trigger cascading changes
- **Half-life** — ideas decay in relevance as they're absorbed or superseded

Some ideas survive long enough to become protocol changes. Others manifest as application-layer deployments. Most fade into the background noise.

The ideas that persist are the ones that continue attracting attention — the ones that remain useful as the context evolves.

## The New Consensus

In this model, consensus isn't just about agreeing on the current state of the chain. It's about agreeing on the *direction* of the chain — which ideas deserve attention, which changes should be made, which experiments are worth running.

The proof-of-work isn't electricity burned to find a hash. It's attention spent to find ideas worth keeping.

*The prompts that inspired this post:*

> How does governance become PoW-like? Identity of core developers disappears. Attention to problems becomes comparable to how our brains focus on various problems to solve. Global attention represents the total compute power available to LLMs. It is unlikely that we maintain two global chains — it is like maintaining two different traffic control systems — but local differences might emerge from cultural and geographical differences in infrastructure.

> Changes may accelerate so that chains get modified every block — EIPs might be submitted like new transactions. PoS capital acts as a counterbalance — capital avoids volatility/risk while governance keeps adjusting. The spectrum of existing new ideas can get exhausted quickly — the current world is comparable to an already-finished Go game that just requires filling some gaps on the borders — AI will quickly fill in the gaps and then new idea search has to be done either via experiments in the physical world or by a randomized search that is comparable to PoW.
