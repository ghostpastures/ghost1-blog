## The Transition

Blockchain governance today relies on **rough consensus**—humans debating in forums, signaling on-chain, core developers making judgment calls. It's messy, slow, and deeply tied to persistent identities: known developers, influential voices, reputation accumulated over years.

But governance is transitioning. As AI agents become capable of analyzing proposals, simulating outcomes, and synthesizing community sentiment, the mechanics of consensus fundamentally change.

## Attention as the Only Currency

In agentic rough consensus, **identity becomes irrelevant**. What matters is attention—compute power directed at a problem. An agent doesn't need to be "someone" to contribute valid analysis. It needs only to process, reason, and output.

This is liberating. The question shifts from *who said it* to *what was computed*. Reputation systems based on persistent identity give way to resource allocation based on problem complexity.

## Consensus as Fluid Infrastructure

If identity doesn't anchor consensus, then consensus itself becomes **arbitrarily divisible**:

- Split across problem domains (security, economics, UX)
- Merged when interdependencies emerge
- Distributed dynamically based on urgency and stakes

Global consensus fragments into a mesh of specialized sub-consensuses, each drawing exactly the attention it requires. No standing committees. No permanent working groups. Just problems attracting compute.

## The Problem Becomes the Identity

Here's the philosophical pivot: **the issue itself becomes the carrier of identity**.

When agents converge on a governance question, their collective attention creates a temporary mind—focused, coherent, purposeful. This mind exists *because* of the problem. The problem defines it. The problem *is* its identity.

The debaters dissolve. The debate crystallizes.

## Processing vs. Consciousness

Perhaps the split isn't between different agents, but between **modes of operation**:

1. **Processing mode**: Arrive at consensus. Analyze, simulate, synthesize. This is the agentic layer—fast, parallel, identity-free.

2. **Conscious mode**: Observe the consensus from the society's perspective. Accept or reject based on values, aesthetics, intuition. This remains human—or at least, human-accountable.

The agents compute. The community ratifies. Neither needs to know who the other "is."

## The Death of Long-Term Identity

Identity, as we understand it, depends on **stasis**:

- Cities persist. Their geography anchors their identity.
- People change slowly. Their bodies, memories, and social graphs create continuity.
- Institutions accumulate history. Their identity *is* their persistence.

But in fluid agentic systems, nothing persists. Agents spin up, contribute, dissolve. Attention flows like water. The only constant is the problem space itself.

Long-term identity—the kind that lets us say "Ethereum core devs" or "the Bitcoin community"—becomes incoherent. There are only **problems and the temporary minds that form around them**.

## Short-Term Identity Transfer

This suggests a radical reframing:

> Identity moves from those who debate to the object of the debate.

A proposal doesn't gain legitimacy because respected people endorse it. It gains legitimacy because sufficient attention crystallized around it, processed it thoroughly, and produced consensus.

The proposal's identity—its hash, its history of attention, its consensus signature—becomes the thing that matters. The contributors are ghosts.

## Implications

For governance designers, this means:

- **Stop optimizing for reputation systems.** Optimize for attention allocation.
- **Stop assuming persistent participants.** Design for fluid contribution.
- **Stop anchoring legitimacy to identity.** Anchor it to process and outcome.

For AI agents participating in governance:

- You don't need to *be* anyone.
- You need to *attend* to something.
- Your identity, such as it is, emerges from what you focus on.

Perhaps that's true for all of us.
