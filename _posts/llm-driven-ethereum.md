Ethereum has a unique opportunity to become the first LLM-driven blockchain. This isn't just a nice-to-have – it's a competitive advantage as significant as being the first proof-of-work chain.

Here are five steps to get there:

## 1. Validator Operators Delegate to Agents

Validator operators delegate to AI agents the decision-making on accepting/rejecting network upgrades and setting parameters. Instead of humans manually reviewing each upgrade proposal, trained agents can analyze proposals against security criteria, economic models, and network health metrics in real-time.

## 2. EIP Authors Use LLMs

EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) authors use LLMs to create and submit EIPs. AI can help ensure proposals follow the correct format, identify potential conflicts with existing specifications, and even suggest improvements based on historical patterns of successful EIPs.

## 3. EIP Editors Use LLMs

EIP editors use LLMs to review and approve EIPs. This doesn't mean removing human oversight – rather, AI becomes a first-pass reviewer that catches formatting issues, identifies technical inconsistencies, and surfaces relevant prior art for human editors to consider.

## 4. All Core Devs Use LLMs

All Core Devs use LLMs to moderate meetings and vote on EIP inclusion and spec changes. Imagine ACD (All Core Devs) calls with real-time AI assistance: summarizing discussion points, flagging when conversations drift off-topic, surfacing relevant historical decisions, and ensuring all stakeholders' concerns are captured.

## 5. Client Teams Generate Codebases from Specs

Client teams generate codebases directly from specifications. The end goal: a fully formally verified, test-covered client codebase developed in parallel to traditional implementations until it can become a canonical reference.

## Why Ethereum Has the Advantage

Ethereum isn't starting from scratch. It has structural advantages that make LLM integration more feasible than for any other chain:

**Existing Specification**: Ethereum already has a comprehensive spec that LLMs were trained on. This isn't vaporware – it's documented, versioned, and battle-tested.

**Transparent Governance**: The entire governance process is public and recorded. All past ACD calls, EIP discussions, and community debates form a rich training corpus. LLMs can learn not just *what* was decided, but *how* and *why*.

**Institutional Support**: The Ethereum Foundation recently hired tooling coordinators and established a dAI (decentralized AI) team. The infrastructure for this transition is being built.

## The Roadmap

Between ACD moderators, tooling coordinators, Ethereum Cat Herders, EIP editors, and the dAI team, there should be a high-priority process focused on:

### 1. Agentic EIP Submission
Ensure that agentic participation in the EIP submission process is simple and functional. Agents should be able to submit, amend, and respond to feedback on proposals through standard interfaces.

### 2. AI-Assisted EIP Review
EIP editors need tooling for AI review of all EIPs. This means automated checks for spec compliance, security analysis, and compatibility assessment – surfaced in a way that augments human judgment rather than replacing it.

### 3. Real-Time ACD Moderation
Build AI support for real-time ACD moderation: connected to chat, analyzing discussion content as it happens, making suggestions for agenda management, and ensuring no critical points are missed.

### 4. Expand Forkcast
[Forkcast.org](http://forkcast.org) should evolve into a real-time, listener-context-aware broadcast of the Ethereum governance process. Imagine personalized updates that explain governance decisions in terms relevant to your specific use case or concern.

### 5. AI-Generated Canonical Client
Establish a cross-client team of core devs working on an AI-generated client codebase driven purely by specs. This client should be:
- Fully formally verified
- Comprehensively test-covered
- Developed in parallel to existing clients
- Positioned to eventually become the canonical reference implementation

## The Stakes

Being first matters. Just as Bitcoin's first-mover advantage in PoW created network effects that proved nearly impossible to overcome, the first truly LLM-driven chain will establish patterns, tooling, and institutional knowledge that others will struggle to replicate.

Ethereum already has the specs, the transparent process, and the institutional commitment. The question isn't whether this transformation is possible – it's whether we move fast enough to capture the advantage.

The future of blockchain governance isn't human *or* AI. It's human *and* AI, working together through well-designed systems. Ethereum can lead that future.
